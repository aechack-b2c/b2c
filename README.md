## Challenge

We decided to tackle the challenge presented by Ramboll and HL titled "_Pedestrian Bridges – Open-Source Planning for Sustainable Mobility_".

The challenge addresses the lack of proper pedestrian infrastructure in urban areas, especially across railway lines and highways. T
his deficiency leads to accidents, fatalities, and accessibility challenges for pedestrians, particularly for people with mobility limitations. 
The goal is to improve pedestrian safety, urban walkability, and carbon reduction.

This challenge is about developing open-source tools to optimize pedestrian bridge placement and design, enhancing sustainable mobility, and reducing ecological 
impact while improving community accessibility. Proposed solutions may e.g. include GIS-based tools, generative design models, and community-driven decision-making platforms.
